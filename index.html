          collapsed into a pile of hay, the wolf opened his jaws very wide and
          bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran
          away to hide with the second little pig.

          The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house
          made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside,
          and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they
          would make.

          So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! As the cabin
          collapsed into a pile of sticks, the wolf was greedy and he tried to
          catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His
          big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs
          scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.

          The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they
          made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf
          could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened,
          they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true.
          The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite
          chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them
          inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely
          feast.
        </p>
        <p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p>
        <h2>Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in!</h2>
        <p>
          But the little pigs saw the wolf's glowing eyes through the keyhole,

        <h2>No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!</h2>
        <p>Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p>

          Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed,
          huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down.
          At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't
          puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.

        <p>
          But this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he
          would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a
          blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil.

          pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding
          water.

        <p>
          So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and
          the three little pigs ate him for supper.
